# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Project Description

This project was made to learn how to do a sidebar. The sidebar is hidden until the hamburger is clicked. If you choose an item on the sidebar, the site will navigate to that page and then the sidebar once again disappears.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
